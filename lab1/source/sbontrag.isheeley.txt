All parts of the multi-service server work correctly. HTTP requests are completed and pings respond with correct message and sequence numbers. A print statement is required on line 80 before handlePing(). if it is not there, then the ping is not properly reponded to. We can't seem to figure out why this is, but assume it has to do with values needing time to be set. If the print statement is not there, then it takes running the client 3 times before the server responds correctly. After the third time, every client request following works perfectly.
